<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a cat-loving curious person who's just doing their best in the world.</p>

<p>I like to read, climb, hike in nature, go out for walks with Leo (our dog), listen to music, drink tea, meditate, and drive.</p>

<p>I just got a job as a business analyst! I start on the 15th of September, after my univeristy graduation ceremony. I am working on this web development course for my own sake of working on my skills and having fun.</p>
